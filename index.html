               <h3>Why Snowboarding?</h3>
               <p class = "funParagraph">Snowboarding is one of the most fun hobbies that I"ve been able to pick in the past few years. It's one of the few experiences that you can combine the aspects of extreme sports and the beautiful nature around you. There's nothing quite like carving down a mountain in peace and then watching either your friends or yourself catch an edge and fall face first into the snow. It doesn't however have to be extreme, there are different types of slopes for everyone ranging typically from green to blacks and the nice thing is that you can go slow and enjoy the view or bring out the adrenaline junky and speed down the mountain. </p>
               <h3>Gear and what you'll need!</h3>
                  <ol>
                     <li>A Snowboard: Renting a snowboard is usually the best course for beginners because different snowboards are made to do different things so the resort will give you one best tailored to beginners. Some boards are used for powder days, some are park boards, and some are used tailored to carve better in the snow. </li>
                     <li>Bindings: Binding are also important because they're the equipment that keeps you attached to the snowboard and stop you from flying off! The park will also have these rentals available!</li>
                     <li>Boots: Snowboard boots attach to your bindings and are water proof to keep your feet entirely warm. These are also available to rent!</li>
                     <li>Helmet and goggles: Even though there is snow a lot of it is packed down from lots of people riding over it all day, This basically makes it hard ice which makes a helmet important. Not wearing one can be extremely dangerous! Goggles are also a must have because of how much sun glare off of the white snow, this can cause damage to your eyes, but it also protects from the wind and snow!</li>
                     <li>Waterproof pants, jacket, and gloves: You will need these especailly when starting out because you will fall a lot! Everyone does!</li>
                     <li>Lift Tickets: Lift tickets are there so you can take the lifts up the mountain.</li>
                  </ol>

               <h3>Learning how to Snowboard</h3>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Be Patient: The worst thing you can do is get frustrated. It takes time because you have to build those specific muscles as well as build your muscle memory. You will fall a LOT and i mean a LOT.</li>
                     <li>Advice: Try to time your snowboarding days on days with fresh snow. It won't hurt as much when you fall infact it'll feel like you're falling on pillows!</li>
                     <li>Go slow: Start on the smaller trails, typically there are bunny slopes to help you get a feel for your board!</li>
                     <li>Help!: Try taking lessons or go with someone who is experienced. It helped me dramatically and I was able to go down the blues by the 4th day!</li>
                  </ol>
